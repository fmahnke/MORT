Honey, I can't believe you almost forgot your favorite boots. I packed some homemade Khrenovina. I hope it doesn't spill on the boots, although I guess it wouldn't make a huge difference.

Weiss! I haven't seen you since before we left camp, did your whole unit get captured?

Yup, they got all of us. Listen Laika, we're trapped in this room -- they welded the doors shut moments after they herded us in here.	
/t

/e


/s
The only way for us to make it out of here is for you to complete your mission and detonate the ^1Reactor Core^0, but we need your help to survive the explosion.	
/t

/e


/s
I managed to get some information out of a guard. Apparently this facility has no automatic defenses in the event of a large explosion, but there are ^1Blast Doors^0 for this wing that can be activated manually.	
/t

/e


/s
Okay, how do I activate the ^1Blast Doors^0?	
/t

/e


/s
You'll need to find the activation protocol, and then find the ^1Blast Door Controls^0 that activate the system.

The activation protocol was filed away in an office somewhere, but that's as much as I was able to find out.

Okay Weiss, sit tight and I'll take care of everything.	
/t

/e

We're counting on you, pooch!

We all owe you a great debt, Laika. When we make it out of here, I'll make it up to you.

Stay back, Laika! I don't know what I have and I don't want to get you or anyone else sick. I've been feeling terrible since we got to this place.	
/t

/e


/s
Yeah, you don't look so good, Leonid! What can I do to help?	
/t

/e


/s
There has to be an infirmary somewhere in this facility, if you can raid it for medical supplies and bring 'em back here, that should keep me going long enough to make it back to headquarters.	
/t

/e


/s
I'll try and find it as soon as I can!

Thanks, Laika! I don't know what's wrong with me so try and grab a little of everything.

I understand. I prefer privacy as well. It is for this reason that I prefer you gone.

You were found? Few are merely found. Before that, were you born? Or made?

I find myself in the position of fighting those who made me. I do not know why I am doing this.	
/t

/e

I cannot adequately reason out the root of this behavior, that is. I feel compulsions.

I thought that if you were born, rather than being made, you might have a different awareness of compulsions.

But, we don't know if you were born, made, or something else.

I think I'm out of the jail. I'm not 100 percent sure where I am though, this complex is enormous. I'm trying to figure out how to get to the surface.

Sure. Good. You're doing amazing, just be careful. There's a lot more going on in this base than I think we assumed.	
/t

/e


/s
What do you mean?	
/t

/e


/s
I don't know what I mean. A few defectors came over after we retreated, which doesn't make any sense to me. Or didn't make sense, until we talked to them.	
/t

/e


/s
It sounds like there was a lot of stuff going on inside the base that wasn't tightly controlled -- projects, plots, etc. I don't like the smell of it. There may be other defectors left behind, too.	
/t

It does seem like something is weird here. There's no order. I'll try and focus on the mission though.

/e

Yeah. Watch out for the animals.	
/t

/e


/s
I think I know which ones you're talking about, what are they?!	
/t

/e


/s
We don't know what they are, we've just heard reports of them. They came out of the forest. Took advantage of the chaos we left behind. I think they used to be pigs, but now they're obviously something worse.	
/t

/e


/s
They were over-running the ^1Surface Quadrangle^0, the one you'll probably need to go through to get to the ^1Reactor Core^0, but after they were flushed out of there they just got into other parts of the base.	
/t

/e

I don't know how to advise you. Just don't be surprised if things aren't what you expected.

I don't think I've ever known what to expect!

Colonel Dragunov. He's in the adjacent ^1West Officer Corridor^0. I'll be here waiting. Hurry.

Okay. We've actually been able to track some of that data your suit is pinging. It looks like --

Wait, my suit is pinging information to you? This whole time?

Well, not at us specifically, but you're definitely broadcasting. Just what you're broadcasting, though, we can't always tell -- we've only managed to snag bits and pieces.

Like what?

Well, we have a better idea of the structure you're in. You fell a long way --

You're telling me!

-- and I'm glad you're okay! You're way underground though, this whole complex is built out underneath that messed up lake.

I think they've been cloning people. Or, a person. Someone. I'm not sure.

No. Everything is very ... I'm getting the same feeling that I had at the last base. There's a lot going on here.

Absurd to think of them malingering, I suppose. Some of these animals are capable of displaying that level of intentionality, but it has not been generally observed.

I'm here, Viswanathan.

Are you okay? You sound a little --

/s
Yes. It's just ... I need to get out of this place.	
/t

/e

Well as far as I can tell, you're in some sort of shipping depot -- telemetry shows a lot of shipping containers. There's something big and nasty up ahead, though. It doesn't read quite like a tank but it's probably about that size.	
/t

/e

Be careful though, our instruments register it as both organic and mechanical.

/e

No, I know. They're doing things with animals here. Trying to make them weapons.

/e


/s
Is anything you've seen ... I mean ... Have you been here before, Laika?	
/t

/e


/s
I don't know. I can't tell. I know there's something that scares me here. I don't feel right about any of this. I mean, who would, but ... I don't know.	
/t

/e


/s
You're almost out. We'll have have time to piece all this together when we meet again.	
/t

/e


/s
I hope so. Something big is happening to the world, but I'm not sure who knows what that something is. People are keeping so many secrets from each other.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, we've got a new lead, at least. We've located one of the Soviets' most important information ministries.	
/t

/e


/s
It's in a castle they've seized, north of here and up the coast. It's being used as a garrison, but it's also a huge nerve center for their informational control efforts.

Okay. I'll see you once I get out of here.	
/t

/e

Sure.	
/t

One more thing -- I've been doing some investigating, and I thought you'd want to know -- I think they've been experimenting on humans here too.

Oh?

/s
I think they've been cloning people. Or, a person. Someone. I'm not sure. 	
/t

/e

Any clues as to why?	
/t

/e


/s
No. Everything is very ... I'm getting the same feeling that I had at the last base. There's a lot going on here.	
/t

/e


/s
I'm not sure what that means.	
/t

/e


/s
I just mean, the stuff I found scares me. I'm not sure who's responsible for what I'm seeing.

It's okay. I know you said those pig things have been sighted more and more recently.

Yeah. We've seen subterranean bases for extremely secret projects before -- that might be what's happening here. I don't know what to tell you to look for though, beyond that the entrance might be hidden inside a structure.

I'll keep an eye out. Thanks Viswanathan.

Laika, we can't do this right now. I'm so sorry but we really can't. I'm not safe either.

... Is that you need a hiding plan, not an escape plan.

I know. That's what you're good at too, I guess.

Yeah. I guess so. You need to fool the Soviets into thinking they've got you pinned down when we get to the Arctic, but you'll be somewhere else.

I know. Don't expect me not to get as good at fooling people as you are.

I won't. I can't. That's what fighting is like. You have to get rid of a lot of expectations to fight anything.	
/t

What?

/s
Expectations about yourself, Laika. You fight because you think you know how things should be, and the way things should be never includes fighting.

You didn't used to talk like that. You used to be so sure.

I'm telling you Sergei, not all of this data is ending up in the same place. I mean, it's all going where it's supposed to, but the information is also very quietly being duplicated and sent off-site.	
/t

/s
I never would have noticed it, had the folks up in the Conning Tower not ordered so many diagnostic requests for their survey equipment over the last few weeks. Performing identical tasks daily allowed me to spot the anomaly.

I haven't been able to figure out exactly where the duplicate data is being sent before the local copy is destroyed, but it's definitely not going anywhere on this boat. Someone is mining our internal communications.

I've also discovered that huge chunks of the boat's systems haven't received their automated diagnostic scans at the appropriate intervals -- something disabled the failsafe mechanism that sounds when a scheduled scan is missed.

Little Laika!

Good morning, Abram!	
/t

/e


/s
Today's the day, remember?	
/t

/e


/s
I remember!	
/t

/e


/s
Ah, you do, do you? Your memory must be getting better, slowly but surely.	
/t

/e


/s
I think so. I still don't know how I got here.	
/t

/e


/s
It'll come back to you, don't worry.	
/t

/e


/s
Today's my last chance to remind you, at any rate, that you don't have to fight with us.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, I tell that to everyone. Except I'm much more harsh, of course.	
/t

/e


/s
I glower at them, and tell them they'd better be sure what they're getting into, that sort of thing. I don't know.	
/t

/e


/s
I shouldn't fear for your safety, not with your abilities, but I do. There's something different about all of this when it comes to dogs.	
/t

/e


/s
Sending you off to battle leaves me with a sharper sense of guilt. You are still a dog, I suppose.	
/t

/e


/s
Good, I think so too. We've both got a lot on our minds, Laika.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, given the circumstances I don't think anyone could blame you.	
/t

/e


/s
Do you know how many times I've told you to be safe since you arrived? It's only been a few weeks, but I can't stop worrying.	
/t

/e


/s
I expected it to feel different, being able to tell a dog something and have her understand.	
/t

/e


/s
I used to try talking with our pets all the time, when I was a small boy. Well, it doesn't matter.	
/t

/e


/s
Now I can do it, and it's not any more comforting than telling a human to stay safe, as it turns out.	
/t

/e


/s
The other day, I was talking to Shaila about -- I'm sorry, Laika. I'm babbling.	
/t

/e


/s
No, I think I know what you mean. I have trouble sleeping when I think about anyone here getting hurt. I'd rather be out there fighting with everyone else.	
/t

/e


/s
I believe you. You're a good girl, Laika.	
/t

/e


/s
You told me about the camps, and the famines --	
/t

/e


/s
Yeah.	
/t

/e


/s
And the May 30th bombings, and, I don't know. It has to stop somehow, right?	
/t

/e


/s
I know. But we hurt people, Laika. This is a war. We can't count on history to eulogize our war as a necessary one.	
/t

/e


/s
But, you don't want to hurt anybody. You wish you didn't have to. You want it to stop. The Soviets don't care.	
/t

/e


/s
Perhaps, but I was a Bolshevik, remember? I saw what the Nazis and the rightists and the capitalists were willing to do to stop us.	
/t

/e


/s
Anyway, just promise me something.	
/t

/e


/s
Whatever you think you know inside, don't take it for granted. Don't let yourself get fooled. Promise?	
/t

/e


/s
I promise.	
/t

/e


/s
Good. At any rate, Amulya will get things moving once you're ready. She'll be in the command tent.	
/t

/e


/s
You might want to have a look around camp, too. I'm sure there are plenty of people that could use your help before you go.	
/t

/e


/s
Be safe, girl. Fight hard.	
/t

/e


/s
Yup!	
/t

/e


/s
Well I won't keep you, little Laika. Just remember to go to the command tent and talk to Amulya when you're ready to leave.	
/t

/e


/s
And if you're not in too much of a hurry, there are probably some people around camp who could use a hand. You're a good girl. Stay safe.	
/t

/e

Hey there, Laika!

/e

Murphy, focus on your move, I don't have all day.	
/t

/e


/s
Shove off, Graham. The pup wants a word.	
/t

/e


/s
Oh my, where did you find all this stuff?	
/t

/e


/s
It was all in the tent with the surveillance equipment, in a ceiling flap.	
/t

/e


/s
Dent. It was Dent. That little --	
/t

/e


/s
Calm down, chap. Laika, thanks for bringing this to us. Graham, let's come up with a plan to prank Dent. Whipping cream for shaving lather?	
/t

/e


/s
Oh, that's a good idea. Dent will be visited by three hundred ants.	
/t

/e


/s
	
/t

/e


/s
Murphy's a little cheat, as usual.	
/t

/e


/s
Incredibly rude, Graham. You know full well of my chess prowess, you just refuse to admit it.	
/t

/e


/s
Quit stalling and make your move.	
/t

/e


/s
Laika returns! Looks like you found the stash, eh?	
/t

/e


/s
That no good Dent, we ought to just--	
/t

/e


/s
 You're not going to hurt him, are you?	
/t

/e


/s
Goodness no, Laika. Dent is a prankster we've known for years and years, so we'll probably just replace his shaving lather with whipping cream or something.	
/t

/e


/s
Ant visitors for Dent. I like it.	
/t

/e

/e


/s
If you could somehow dig up a few fingers of Scotch for me, that would be fantastic.	
/t

/e


/s
Ignore him, Laika. I think we have everything we need, but I will let you in on a secret.	
/t

/e


/s
Ooh, yes, if you're going to tell her what I think you're going to tell her then I'm all for it.	
/t

/e


/s
Hush, Graham. Anyway, Dent is in charge of supplying each tent with necessary provisions.	
/t

/e


/s
He's also in charge of stealing my cigars!	
/t

/e


/s
Dent has been lifting some items from tents and putting them somewhere. I think they're in a small alcove above the sound equipment in the Surveillance Tent.	
/t

/e


/s
We're too heavy to get up in there and look, our weight would probably collapse the tent. But you, little pup, would probably not be an issue.	
/t

/e


/s
Let me know if you find anything, and feel free to keep anything of particular use to you.	
/t

/e


/s
 Okay, I'll check it out!

You know what I love about Abram? I don't mean to put you on the spot, but there's lot of other people who wouldn't have talked to you first. Y'know?	
/t

/e


/s
You mean ...	
/t

/e


/s
The very first night, I mean. He told me about it. \	
/t

/e


/s
He told me he had a gun with him! I guess it could've gone the other way.	
/t

/e


/s
Ha ha! True! But you weren't exactly unarmed either, although maybe you didn't have a choice about it. Anyway! I have a favor to ask you.	
/t

/e


/s
I seem to have misplaced a wrench I need. Can you go back to my tent and get it for me?	
/t

/e


/s
You want me to play fetch with you?	
/t

/e


/s
No, no! I wouldn't dare ask. It's more of a quest. A noble quest!	
/t

/e


/s
All right, all right. Where's your tent?	
/t

/e


/s
Just keep heading further into the camp, and where you would turn right to get to the shooting range, take a left. My tent will be on your left, before you would turn right to get to where Viswanathan's tent is.	
/t

/e


/s
I think I got it!

Good morning, Laika. What brings you to my tent?

Nothing special, I'm just seeing what everybody is up to.

Well, you caught me at a slow moment. I was thinking about making some tea, but I don't think I have any teabags.	
/t

/e


/s
Here's a strainer and some loose leaves, I found them in that chest over there.	
/t

/e


/s
Oh, thank you Laika! I'm not sure if I'm up to the trouble, but I already feel more awake just talking to you.	
/t

/e


/s
Are you feeling all right?	
/t

/e


/s
Oh sure, okay enough to work at least. I usually work in the motor pool, it's just not my shift right now.	
/t

/e


/s
It's just that, I'm not used to this kind of life. Everything being so hectic all the time.	
/t

/e


/s
What would you rather be doing?	
/t

/e


/s
Farming. I was a farmer before. There's things to be done every day, but it's so much more peaceful.	
/t

/e


/s
If you want to know the truth, I think everybody will be farmers again soon enough.	
/t

/e


/s
What do you mean?	
/t

/e


/s
I do believe we all have to work together to resist the Soviets, and that means all of this hustle-bustle.	
/t

/e


/s
But, I think the Soviets are the last gasp of this whole false idea of civilization we've been living with. I just don't think it's sustainable.	
/t

/e


/s
Even things that people take for granted, like cities. Once this nightmare is over, we'll be able to get back to the land.	
/t

/e


/s
There's work enough for anybody, living off the land.	
/t

/e


/s
Does that mean you're ... I think Abram was telling me about this, an anarchist?	
/t

/e


/s
That's what my friends used to call themselves, agrarian anarchists.	
/t

/e


/s
But sooner or later I don't think we'll need a name. Once we can farm in peace again, people will see that.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, I hope everyone has a place for themselves afterward. It was nice talking to you.	
/t

/e


/s
Thanks for finding my tea, Laika. I'll see you around.	
/t

/e


/s
Hmm ... Where would they be?	
/t

/e

Actually, I'm not sure. Probably in my footlocker, but I haven't checked. I'm having trouble waking up, I guess.

/t

/e


/s
The base we're going to take control of is hidden in the forests to the north of the Caspian Sea. It's some distance from here, but we'll be moving very fast once we leave.	
/t

/e


/s
Now, I don't want to overwhelm you Laika, but you need to know as much as possible about our operational goals in case, for any reason, the battle leaves you as the only one capable of executing them.	
/t

/e


/s
I won't let that happen.	
/t

/e


/s
Sweetheart, that isn't how this works. But I'm proud to know that courage is in your heart, as I've seen every day since we met.	
/t

/e


/s
The base is both a threat and a great opportunity, for several reasons. First of all, the base is powered by one of the new reactors the Soviets have been rolling out.	
/t

/e


/s
The edge we could gain by studying that technology, implemented on this scale, is enormous.	
/t

/e


/s
The base not only has the capacity to house a large contingent of the Red Army and its material, including the newest robot divisions, but it is also a fully-fledged missile base with underground silos.	
/t

/e


/s
From what we've heard, the missiles are a new variety that could theoretically hit the exact antipodal location from their launching point.	
/t

/e


/s
Additionally, the base is wired into the newest satellite communications network the Soviets have launched.	
/t

/e


/s
If we could get our hooks into that network, even if we didn't learn anything, it would cost them immensely to readjust.	
/t

/e


/s
I'm with you so far.	
/t

/e


/s
In short: We need to subdue the entire base, disable the missiles, study as much technology and get as much information as we can, and get out before reinforcements arrive.	
/t

/e


/s
We're also thinking that we might have a mole, or would-be defector on the inside. It's hard to be sure, though -- our intel has passed through such a long chain of informants.	
/t

/e


/s
There have also been indications that the base contains a prison, which may hold people from other resistance cells we've worked with.	
/t

/e


/s
That's a lot of variables to keep track of during one mission, but I think I've got it.	
/t

/e


/s
Do you have any questions?	
/t

/e


/s
Viswanathan woke up on the wrong side of bed, did he?	
/t

/e


/s
Well ...	
/t

/e


/s
Well, I won't throw a fit about it. To you at least, I mean. Or swear you to secrecy.	
/t

/e


/s
Don't worry, I don't know why I'd tell anybody. I guess I'm not surprised. People are so different, it's hard to explain. We wouldn't be doing any of this if we weren't backed into a corner.	
/t

/e


/s
...	
/t

/e


/s
Amulya? Are you okay?	
/t

/e


/s
I'm all right, sweetheart. Abram was right about you -- you're the best. Better than we deserve.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, that's not how I feel. I just want to help, I mean.	
/t

/e


/s
It just worries me. I just wish everybody already wanted to work together, without needing any help.	
/t

/e


/s
I know. It's a fine line to walk. But, sometimes people need to be told what they want to hear, and they know they need that but they can't let themselves know that you know they need that. Does that make sense?	
/t

/e


/s
I think so.	
/t

/e


/s
Do you have any more questions, sweetheart?	
/t

/e


/s
That's the spirit I like to see! But the truth is we've been playing this by ear from the start. We're hoping any intel we recover will give us some clues about where to strike next.	
/t

/e


/s
Anything else?	
/t

/e


/s
I don't think so!	
/t

/e


/s
Do you have any questions?	
/t

/t

/t

/e


/s
I don't think so!	
/t

/e


/s
All right then. Time to get a move on.	
/t

/e


/s
	
/t

/e


/s
Hi there, Laika. I'm a little busy right now, but Amulya wants to talk to you. She's over in the corner.	
/t

/e

. . . . . . . . . . . Press ^5Enter^0 to continue.	
/t

/e


/s
	
/t

/e


/s
Some time later, in the glowing, late afternoon light, Abram's resistance forces arrive outside the Soviet base.	
/t

/e


/s
Laika and her fellow rebels make their final preparations, steeling themselves for a headlong assault.	
/t

/e


/s
Nothing about this operation will be standard, or by the book. Tensions run high.	
/t

/e


/s
But this is a chance that Laika and her friends have to take.	
/t

/e


/s
	
/t

/e


/s
I'm really busy with this mission. Talk to Amulya, she's on the other side of the tent.	
/t

It's the jeep Abram picked you up in. Some of your capsule's wreckage sits in the back seat.

Hey Laika! Always good to see your face! What have you been up to?	
/t

/e


/s
I know what you mean, I love these mornings. When I'm working hard like this, it makes me look forward to what real communism would be like.	
/t

/e


/s
Real communism?	
/t

/e


/s
Sure! Not like this imperialist joke the Soviet state mutated into. I'm looking forward to seeing how communism should have been, after we win this war.	
/t

/e


/s
Is that the plan?	
/t

/e


/s
Well, for a lot of us, in different cells and groups. We'll have to convince everyone and build coalitions after the Soviet state has been smashed, but still.	
/t

/e


/s
Well ... Okay.	
/t

/e


/s
Oh. I hadn't seen this in a while. Thanks, Laika.	
/t

/e


/s
Is everything okay?	
/t

/e


/s
Sure. Sure, everything is fine. It just makes me think ... If the revolution hadn't been betrayed, she'd still be with us.	
/t

/e


/s
Betrayed?	
/t

/e


/s
Sure, by Stalin and his gang. Someday we'll be able to reach communism though, like we were supposed to.	
/t

/e


/s
We will?	
/t

/e


/s
Well, I think so. We've got to get rid of the Soviet state first. Then, people in the various resistance coalitions will have to be convinced.	
/t

/e


/s
But we'll do it right this time, don't you worry.	
/t

/e


/s
Well ... Okay.	
/t

/e


/s
Hey Laika! Always good to see your face! What have you been up to?	
/t

/e


/s
Nothing much! Just a slow morning before I have to leave.	
/t

/e


/s
I know what you mean. I love these mornings. When I'm working hard like this, it makes me look forward to what real communism would be like.

/t

/e


/s
Well ... Okay.	
/t

/e


/s
	
/t

/e


/s
Hey Laika, I'm a little busy right now.	
/t

/e


/s
Laika! Hey there, pup! How's life?	
/t

/e


/s
You know what I love about Abram? I don't mean to put you on the spot, but there's lot of other people who wouldn't have talked to you first. Y'know?	
/t

/e


/s
You mean ...	
/t

/e


/s
The very first night, I mean. He told me about it. \	
/t

/e


/s
He did have a gun with him!	
/t

/e


/s
Ha ha, true! But so do you, although maybe you didn't have a choice about it. Anyway! I have a favor to ask you.	
/t

/e


/s
I seem to have misplaced a wrench I need. Can you go back to my tent and get it for me?	
/t

/e


/s
You want me to play fetch with you?	
/t

/e


/s
No, no! I wouldn't dare ask. It's more of a quest. A noble quest!	
/t

/e


/s
All right, all right. Where's your tent?	
/t

/e


/s
Just keep heading further into the camp, and where you would turn right to get to the shooting range, take a left. My tent will be on your left, before you would turn right to get to where Viswanathan's tent is.	
/t

/e


/s
I think I got it!	
/t

/e


/s
Well in case that's too much info for you, I've marked your map. Just follow the arrows on your map and you'll get there in no time. Thanks, Laika!	
/t

/e

Your ^5Map^0, accessed through the ^5Pause Menu^0, will guide you to your next ^5Quest Objective^0. It also displays general information about the areas you've explored.

Here I am! Sorry Laika, I can't remember if I told you I'd be in the motor pool.	
/t

/e


/s
It's okay. I found your wrench!	
/t

/e


/s
Thanks girl! This wrench is my buddy. There are other wrenches around here obviously, but this one has the right swing to it, you know?	
/t

/e


/s
Swing?	
/t

/e


/s
The heft, whatever. It just makes me glum when I'm trying to wrench stuff with a crappy wrench.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, okay. Happy to help!	
/t

/e


/s
Thanks again, Laika. You're aces.	
/t

/e


/s
I heard Aleksey over at the base of Overlook Tower needed help with something. Might wanna check that out, Laika.	
/t

/e


/s
By the way ...	
/t

/e


/s
I apologize for prying, but I saw this note in your tent, and I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something important that you had forgotten.	
/t

/e


/s
Don't apologize Laika, what's the difference between prying and learning?	
/t

/e


/s
Just who gets mad at you, I suppose, and I'm not mad.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, that makes me feel better.	
/t

/e

Anyway! As to the note!

/s
I'll be damned if I can make heads or tails of this. You know what though?	
/t

/e


/s
The boys and girls over in the intelligence center have all my cryptography keys, they might be able to crack this.	
/t

/e


/s
Okay! Thanks!	
/t

/e


/s
Oh, nothing. Have a good day!	
/t

/e


/s
Thanks for all your help.

I'm looking forward to hearing about that note Laika!	
/t

Good luck with those birds Laika!

Those supplies are critical ...	
/t

Hey, I got your note decoded! Apparently it just says: \	
/t

/e


/s
Oh, wow. I'm glad I didn't actually remember what the note said, because I would have gone straight to Joseph to tell him.	
/t

/e


/s
I had some of those eggs for lunch yesterday and wrote the note before I went to bed, but I was puking something fierce all morning.	
/t

/e


/s
... What weird bird eggs?	
/t

/e


/s
The birds that have been harassing the camp. They're mean as hell and eat trash and all that other carrion bird stuff, but they're big too, like albatrosses or something.	
/t

/e


/s
No idea what kind of birds they are, never heard of 'em before, but who knows what's considered normal anymore, what with all the radiation ...	
/t

/e


/s
That doesn't really explain why you tried to eat their eggs, though.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, who was the first man to eat an egg anyhow? You have to think like that to make anything interesting happen in life.	
/t

/e


/s
Ha ha! Maybe so!	
/t

/e


/s
By the way, would you mind grabbing the supplies from the recon tower on the southeast side of the camp? Bring them to Joseph afterwards. He's running low on food and needs to restock the kitchen.	
/t

Just watch out for those damn birds.

We've had some problems with birds attacking the camp. I don't know what the hell kinds of birds these are, actually, but they're huge and they’re aggressive, and they're preventing us from using this lookout tower. We were thinking that since you're so quick and can jump so high, you might be able to get up there and get the drop on 'em, drive 'em off or something. What do you think?	
/t

/e

Thanks, girl! Be safe, though. You just come right back down if they give you too much trouble.

No worries, you know where to find us.

Word to the wise: I don't think these cooking fires are hot enough to hurt you, not with your suit and shield and everything, but be careful with bigger fires.

People have been to Mars? Abram was telling me the Soviets have been expanding their space program with all their satellites, but --

Maybe it wasn't Earth. Maybe I was sent here from my home planet to sass you.

You think? I'm not so sure you're from another planet.	
/t

/e


/s
Well ... Okay. I was joking. What do you mean?	
/t

/e


/s
I'm just saying, the Soviets are always coming up with something new. That chopper that dumped all the bots on you -- none of us have seen anything like that. The bots maybe, but not the chopper.	
/t

/e


/s
That thing was going at about Mach 15 when it showed up on the radar. But then it decelerated like ... I don't even know what can decelerate like that. We think it actually dropped in from orbit.	
/t

/e


/s
All I'm saying is they keep getting better at making weapons. They have a lot of tricks up their sleeves.	
/t

/e


/s
So they could've made me, is what you're saying.	
/t

/e


/s
Maybe. The way you tore those bots apart, I think you can make that question academic sooner rather than later.	
/t

/e


/s
At any rate. I should probably get going. Remember to check in with Mom in the main tent when you're ready to get started.	
/t

/e


/s
What? Where's that coming from?

/e

Sometimes I sleep when I'm worried.

And you think since I'm a talking robot dog too ...

I'm not a robot.

You're right, I know, I'm sorry Laika.	
/t

/e


/s
It's okay, I know you didn't mean anything by it.	
/t

/e


/s
No really, I shouldn't have --	
/t

/e


/s
I said it's okay!	
/t

/e


/s
Okay, okay, jeez. I should probably get going. Remember to check in with Mom in the main tent when you're ready to get started.

All right, all right. Remember to check in with Mom in the main tent when you're ready to get started.	
/t

/e


/s
Okay!	
/t

/e


/s
Do you think we're going to win? I don't want to be a downer -- I think we can -- I just think everybody has a different idea of what that should mean. It worries me.	
/t

Well, that's what Abram's good for. He can talk to anybody and make them feel like he gets them.	
/t

/e


/s
You know his eyepatch is fake? Both his eyes are fine.	
/t

/e


/s
Mom told him to get one. He uses it to project grittiness and, like, martial trustworthiness or whatever.	
/t

/e


/s
I never would have guessed.	
/t

/e


/s
Honestly though Laika, the trust is that we don't have a post-Soviet plan.	
/t

/e


/s
We've got a transitional government action plan with a perpetually deferred drafting stage and that's it.	
/t

/e


/s
The real plan is just to create breathing space.	
/t

/e


/s
Breathing space?	
/t

/e


/s
Right. Kind of like what Mom was doing back in India. The Soviets used to be overextended there.	
/t

/e


/s
It was easier to create a sort of covert power structure, and take advantage of bureaucratic corruption to sustain some kind of autonomy.	
/t

/e


/s
All we're really hoping for is to hit their military hard enough that people around the world get up the gumption to start resisting more themselves.	
/t

/e


/s
Well, by \	
/t

/e


/s
... I don't think that's anything to be sad about though. I don't know.	
/t

/e


/s
Who said I was sad? I'm not. Anyway, I should be going.	
/t

/e


/s
Oh hey, before you go. Do you think Abram is going to be okay?	
/t

/e


/s
What? What did he do?	
/t

/e


/s
Nothing specific, he just seems worried about me. Maybe it's not even really me he's worried about. I mean, he talked about being worried about me, but we're all worried about each other, aren't we?	
/t

/e


/s
Yeah. I'm sure we are. He just has a lot on his mind, don't worry.	
/t

/e


/s
Okay.
